        <p>The Japanese spider crab (<i>Macrocheira kaempferi</i>) gets its name from its resemblance to a spider. It has an orange body with white spots on its legs. The short, stubby eye stalks are located on the front of the carapace and two thin spines stick out between them. Short, spiny tubercles also cover the carapace. In male specimens, the limbs on which the claws are located become longer than its other limbs.</p>
        <p>Japanese spider crabs are omnivorous and scavenge for food. In its natural habitat it feeds on shellfish and dead animals. They can eat algae, plants, mollusks and small fish, catching and tearing up the meat in their powerful pincers. Their long legs enable them to move quite quickly and stalk their prey.</p>
